# Image-Classification-using-TensorFlow
Using TensorFlow's Transfer Learning models to classify images of beans

The dataset for this project is  taken  from https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview. You can choose any dataset you want and adjust the code accordingly. 

This project is my attempt at learning and understanding Image Classification using Tensorflow. I have referred to the AI Engineering Channel on YouTube which made it possible to do this.

The link to the project video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84J1fMklQWE&t=5s

More details on the project shall be updated soon.
